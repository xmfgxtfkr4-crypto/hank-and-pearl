          <span class="dropcap">W</span>inter came for the Crimson Orb at dusk. It appeared
          on the Great Wall of the living chamber, moving with the cunning of a Lannister
          and the speed of a Dothraki rider. Sir Hank, Warden of the Couch, knew what
          had to be done.
        </p>
        <p>
          He launched himself from the arm of the sofa with the fury of a direwolf,
          claws extended, eyes black as dragonglass. Three times the orb escaped his
          grasp. Three times he struck the wall with nothing to show for it. On the
          fourth assault, he pinned it beneath his mighty paw&mdash;only for it to
          vanish like wildfire in the wind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The orb was last seen retreating beyond the Wall. Sir Hank has sworn a blood
          oath: he will not rest until the realm is free of its menace. The Night's Watch
          has been put on alert.

          the Queen tires of them, which is to say, never.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the so-called right of "needing to use the bathroom" is hereby
          abolished. The Queen has spoken. The Queen does not care.

        <p>
          <span class="dropcap">T</span>he realm has not seen such bloodshed since the
          Treat Famine of last Tuesday. A cardboard box of extraordinary craftsmanship
          arrived in the Great Hall, and both houses immediately laid claim. Alliances
          crumbled. Trust was shattered. Someone knocked a cup off the counter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sir Hank marched from the east with a flanking manoeuvre worthy of Robb Stark.
          But Queen Pearl held the box with an iron will and a devastating hiss that
          could curdle milk. She deployed the ancient technique of "making herself
          slightly larger," and Hank's forces broke like waves upon the rocks of
          Dragonstone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hank retreated to the Paper Bag of Exile, vowing revenge. The small council
          convened. Treats were demanded by both sides. The humans, as always, bent the knee.

          the ungodly howling of Sir Hank, who at the third hour past midnight was
          seized by a creative vision so powerful that silence was not an option.
        </p>
        <p>
          His opus&mdash;a haunting ballad entitled "MRROOOWWW (Reprise in D Minor)"&mdash;echoed
          through the corridors of the Red Keep like dragonfire through King's Landing.
          The servants (humans) awoke in a panic. A pillow was thrown. Hank accepted it
          as tribute from a conquered people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Queen Pearl, roused from her slumber atop the Iron Lap, issued a formal
          complaint calling the performance "an act of war" and "grounds for
          banishment to the balcony." Sir Hank's response was to perform an encore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Critics be damned. The bards will sing of this night for generations.

          seven minutes. In the annals of the realm, few atrocities have matched this
          betrayal. Queen Pearl stationed herself beside the empty bowl and stared
          into the soul of the Hand of the Kitchen with eyes that could melt the Wall.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sir Hank, in an unusual display of alliance, joined the protest by sitting
          directly in front of the pantry door. Together they formed a blockade so
          devastating that the humans had no choice but to comply. The kibble flowed.
          The wet food followed. Balance was restored.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the Seven Rooms remember. The late feeding will not be forgotten. The
          North remembers. Pearl remembers. Hank already forgot, but he remembers
          the general concept of injustice.
